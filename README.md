RUN THE PROGRAM 

After running you will see a blank image with several buttons and text fields, click the “Refresh” button to generate 4 random card images(see below) 

STEP 2. 

ENTER EXPRESSION 

Upon clicking the refresh button, a timer will begin tracking the time it takes for the user to solve the problem. 
Enter an expression in the textbox located near the bottom of the screen. Make sure that your expression uses the four numbers from the four selected cards. 
Each number must be used once and only once. You can use the four arithmetic operators
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and parentheses in the expression. The expression must evaluate to 24. 
(Example Below) 

 

STEP 3. 

CLICK VERIFY BUTTON 

 After entering the expression, click the verify button to validate whether the numbers in the expression evaluate to 24 and the numbers pictured on the cards are used once and only once 
 (Note that such an expression might not exist) In this case, click the Refresh button to get another set of four. The result of your attempt will be displayed, 
 and your attempt will be saved to a log file in the resource folder. The timer will stop upon a correct answer.
